## What is TF2Stadium?

TF2Stadium is a community-driven, open source TF2 lobby
website. Beyond that, we are an organization devoted to the betterment
of the competitive TF2 community.

## How did the project begin?

When multiple users on a TFTV thread began pledging their assorted
skills and expertise to a new lobby site, R.E.M. decided to gather all
of them together to work on a project which was focused upon and
driven by the community with the additional aim of trying to bridge
the skill gap between the leagues and lobby sites/pubs.

Within a few days, nearly 50 people had shown an interest in working
on the project and what would later become TF2Stadium was born. While
active contributors have come and gone and the team has been
streamlined where needed, we maintain a diverse and talented staff,
many of which have been here since day one. These contributors range
from back-end developers to community figures and everything in
between. Of course, every one of these contributors had their own
reasons for getting involved and these vary from person to
person. Some wanted to apply their personal skills and talents to
enrich the competitive scene and others simply wished to give back to
the game they love.

Ultimately, TF2Stadium was never meant to be just another lobby
site. In addition to the various features we're working on, we're also
busy discussing and planning ways of supporting other projects which
we believe benefit the community.

## What are lobbies?

Lobbies are semi-organised games between two teams of players in a
mock-competitive environment. Theyâ€™re a great way to get a feel for
the competitive format of TF2 without having to join a league or
organise a team. The two major formats used in lobbies (and
competitive as a whole) are 6s (6v6) and Highlander (9v9).

## Why do you use Mumble?

[Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) is a free and open
source VoIP (Voice over IP) program that has become the standard for
competitive play in the TF2 community. Whilst we are aware of upcoming
alternatives (such as Discord), the decision was made early on to
stick with Mumble because of its prevalent use in the competitive
community.

## How do I gain knowledge about 6s, Highlander and competitive as a whole?

Moving from public play to competitive play may seem daunting at
first, but the community has many resources available for helping
newcomers to learn the format and intricacies of the competitive
community. [playcomp.tf](http://playcomp.tf) is a good starting point
to learning about the basic formats in the competitive scene as well
as the popular leagues in each region.

For more indepth knowledge on the formats and the individual classes
[comp.tf](http://comp.tf) is a great wiki-style site with information
on the competitive role of each individual class.

As always the best way to get to know the formats and the way
competitive is played is just by playing, and lobbies are a great way
to get started.

## Why keep the site up when matchmaking is here?

When TF2Stadium began, matchmaking had not been formally
announced. With matchmaking now having been released it has become 
quite clear that whilst many players are happy to use it there 
are some who still prefer to use lobbies because of their enforcement 
of the accepted competitive class meta through class limits, their use
of whitelists used already in competitive play, and for the ability to 
play other gamemodes such as Highlander. We want to make sure that
everyone in the TF2 community is able to play the way they want 
to which is why we've keep the site running even after the 
introduction of matchmaking. 

## How do I report people during a game?

Say: !rep _team_ _slot-name_

Where team is: our, their, red, blu or blue.

And slot-name is:

*   4v4: scout, soldier, demoman, medic
*   6s: scout1, scout2, roamer, pocket, demoman
*   Highlander: scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, spy
*   Bball: soldier1, soldier2
*   Ultiduo: soldier, medic

Example: Say "!rep their heavy" to report player occupying Heavy slot
on the other team.

## Can I leave a game in progress?

If you need to leave the game at any point type "!sub" in chat - it
will have an immediate effect of reporting yourself. Please use it
responsibly and not as a justification to join lobbies 
you don't think you can finish.
