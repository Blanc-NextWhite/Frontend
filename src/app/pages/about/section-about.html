  <h1>TF2Stadium Mission Statement</h1>

  <p>Our mission is to provide a place for players of all skill levels to
  play competitive TF2 and to offer a welcoming place of learning for
  those new to the community.</p>

  <p>This organisation aims to be as transparent and democratic as
  possible in its operations. Therefore, all code
  is <a href="https://github.com/TF2Stadium" target="_blank">open
  source and freely available to the public</a>. The site itself will
    remain free of charge for all users.</p>

  <p>TF2Stadium is generously supported
  by <a href="https://www.tragicservers.com/"
        target="_blank">tragicservers.com</a></span>.</p>

  <p>TragicServers provided a VPS for our web and mumble servers along
  with an abundance of NA game servers. We couldn't have done this
  project without taking community donations if not for Tragic, and we
  really appreciate the generous support he gives us. If you're in the
  market for a TF2 server (or other game servers like Minecraft and
  Counterstrike, among others), please show your appreciation by using
  coupon code STADIUM to get 50% off the first month.</p>
