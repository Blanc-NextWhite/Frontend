  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h2>What is TF2Stadium?</h2>
  <p>TF2Stadium is a community-driven, open source TF2 lobby
  website. Beyond that, we are an organization devoted to the
  betterment of the competitive TF2 community.</p>

  <h2>How did the project begin?</h2>
  <p>When multiple users on a TFTV thread began pledging their
  assorted skills and expertise to a new lobby site, R.E.M. decided to
  gather all of them together to work on a project which was focused
  upon and driven by the community with the additional aim of trying
  to bridge the skill gap between the leagues and lobby
  sites/pubs.</p>
  <p>Within a few days, nearly 50 people had shown an interest in
  working on the project and what would later become TF2Stadium was
  born. While active contributors have come and gone and the team has
  been streamlined where needed, we maintain a diverse and talented
  staff, many of which have been here since day one. These
  contributors range from back-end developers to community figures and
  everything in between. Of course, every one of these contributors
  had their own reasons for getting involved and these vary from
  person to person. Some wanted to apply their personal skills and
  talents to enrich the competitive scene and others simply wished to
  give back to the game they love.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, TF2Stadium was never meant to be just another lobby
  site. In addition to the various features we're working on, we're
  also busy discussing and planning ways of supporting other projects
  which we believe benefit the community.</p>

  <h2>What are lobbies?</h2>
  <p>Lobbies are semi-organised games between two teams of players in
  a mock-competitive environment. Theyâ€™re a great way to get a feel
  for the competitive format of TF2 without having to join a league or
  organise a team. The two major formats used in lobbies (and
  competitive as a whole) are 6s (6v6) and Highlander (9v9).</p>

  <h2>Why do you use Mumble?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page"
  target="_blank">Mumble</a> is a free and open source VoIP (Voice
  over IP) program that has become the standard for competitive play
  in the TF2 community. Whilst we are aware of upcoming alternatives
  (such as Discord), the decision was made early on to stick with
  Mumble because of its prevalent use in the competitive
  community.</p>

  <h2>How do I gain knowledge about 6s, Highlander and competitive as a whole?</h2>
  <p>Moving from public play to competitive play may seem daunting at
  first, but the community has many resources available for helping
  newcomers to learn the format and intricacies of the competitive
  community. <a href="playcomp.tf" target="_blank">playcomp.tf</a> is
  a good starting point to learning about the basic formats in the
  competitive scene as well as the popular leagues in each
  region.</p>

  <p>For more indepth knowledge on the formats and the individual
  classes <a href="comp.tf" target="_blank">comp.tf</a> is a great
  wiki-style site with information on the competitive role of each
  individual class.</p>

  <p>As always the best way to get to know the formats and the way
  competitive is played is just by playing, and lobbies are a great
  way to get started.</p>

  <h2>Why make this when matchmaking is coming?</h2>
  <p>When TF2Stadium began, matchmaking had not been formally
  announced. After the announcement, the decision was made to continue
  the project regardless to ensure proper gameplay free of trolls and
  hackers.</p>
  <p>No one really knows how matchmaking will turn out when it
  eventually launches. We want to make sure that no matter what
  happens, those who want to make the step from public play to
  competitive play will always have a place to learn, improve, and
  have fun.</p>
