# TF2Stadium Mission Statement

Our mission is to provide a place for players of all skill levels to
play competitive TF2 and to offer a welcoming place of learning for
those new to the community.

This organization aims to be as transparent and democratic as possible
in its operations. Therefore, all code is [open source and freely
available to the public](https://github.com/TF2Stadium). The site
itself will remain free of charge for all users.

You can join our [steam
group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TF2Stadium)! Please post
suggestions, feature requests, and any other questions there.

TragicServers provided a VPS for our web and mumble servers along with
an abundance of NA game servers. We couldn't have done this project
without taking community donations if not for Tragic, and we really
appreciate the generous support he gives us. If you're in the market
for a TF2 server (or other game servers like Minecraft and
Counterstrike, among others), please show your appreciation by using
